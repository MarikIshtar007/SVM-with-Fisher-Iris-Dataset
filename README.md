# SVM-with-Fisher-Iris-Dataset

This project is based on the dataset called Iris flower data set or Fisher's Iris data set. It is a multivariate data set introduced by Sir Ronald Fisher in the 1936 as an example of discriminant analysis. 
The data set consists of 50 samples from each of three species of Iris, namely **Iris setosa**, **Iris virginica** and **Iris versicolor**.
It has a total of 150 samples in total.
Four features were measured from each sample are:
  - sepal length in centimeters
  - sepal width in centimeters
  - petal length in centimeters
  - petal width in centimeters
